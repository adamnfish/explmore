Explmore
========

Provides a handy way to drill on on large datasets on the Grafana Explore screen.

Click the extension while on Grafana's Explore page to turn it on. Thereafter, double-clicking on a cell will dump the cell's data to the browser's console.

It has special handling to help explore JSON data and dates.

This is very helpful in a few cases:
* your data contains large JSON blobs
* you want to be able to easily compare large records across rows
